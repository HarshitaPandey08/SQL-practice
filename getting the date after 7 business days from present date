with d as
(select dateadd(day,7,getdate()) as d1)
select dateadd(day,2*(datediff(week,getdate(),d1)),d1) ,d1  from d



if todays date is 28-02-2023
after seven days the date will be 07-03-2023 
but within those 7 days there is a saturday and sunday which are not business date
therefore our output should be todays date + 7business days=09-03-2023
